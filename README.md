# Reason to create
While reading a book [An Introduction to Formal Logic](https://www.logicmatters.net/ifl/), particularly on page 73 I decided that in order to understand the syntax of Formal Language (say for the simplest propositional logic) better I should create a BNF grammar that describes it.

I found this amazing package [parglare](https://github.com/igordejanovic/parglare) and used it to create a BNF grammar and test (parse) some sentences using this grammar. 

# How to run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python propositional_logic.py
```
